# QR Generator

Welcome to the QR Generator project! This README will guide you through the setup and running of both the backend and frontend components of the application.

## Project Structure

- `backend/` - Contains the backend server code.
- `frontend/` - Contains the frontend code for the user interface.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run both the backend and frontend components.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
   npm install

3. Build the backend project:
   ```bash
   npm run build

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run start

The backend server should now be running and listening for requests.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
The frontend application should now be running in development mode. You can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if configured differently).

### Aditional Information
Ensure that both backend and frontend services are running to fully interact with the QR Generator application.

The backend API and frontend application are expected to be run concurrently, so be sure to start both servers.
